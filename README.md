# The Isaac Bot
## Goal: to learn like a person learns.
The Isaac interprets and adds all users' statements to its semantic knowledge web, querying that web to deliver the most relevant response to future users in response to each comment. Soon, it will reflect on its self, take into account all past lines from the conversation, and be indisguishable from a human texter (It will literally be the amalgam of all the user's that have talked to it before.). The Isaac is in the process of applying to be the first host in West World.
