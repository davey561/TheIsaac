# The Isaac Bot
## Goal: to learn like a person learns.
The Isaac converts user's statement into a semantic knowledge web, querying that web to deliver the most relevant response to the user in response to each comment. Soon, it will reflect on its concept of self, take into account all past lines from the conversation, and be indisguishable from a human texter (It will literally be the amalgam of all the user's that have talked to it before.). Applying to be the first host in West World.
