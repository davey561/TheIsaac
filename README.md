# The Isaac
## Learning from conversation as a person learns.
The Isaac is a chatbot that interprets and adds all users' statements to its semantic knowledge web, querying that web to deliver the most relevant response to future users in response to each comment. Soon, it will reflect on its self, take into account all past lines from the conversation, and be indisguishable from a human texter (It will literally be the amalgam of all the user's that have talked to it before.). The Isaac is in the process of applying to be the first host in West World.

It has currently been taken down for development (too much unwanted traffic). Hopefully, it will be up again in November.

I made The Isaac in the context of an assignment for my Introduction to Cognitive Science course, which asked the students to evaluate existing chatbots. None of them, including Mitsuku (https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/), could learn as well as I thought I could program one to learn. Hence, the Isaac was born.
